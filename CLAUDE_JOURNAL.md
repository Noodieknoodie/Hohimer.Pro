# CLAUDE JOURNAL

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**401(k) Payment Tracking System** - A Microsoft Teams Tab application that tracks advisor fee payments for 401(k) retirement plans.

**TECH STACK**:
- **Platform**: Microsoft Teams Tab (Teams Toolkit)
- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI deployed as Azure Functions in `/api` directory  
- **Database**: Azure SQL Database with Azure AD auth
- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS v4 (migrating from Next.js)
- **Testing**: Backend - Pytest (48 passing), Frontend - Jest configured

**BUSINESS CONTEXT**: 
- Tracks ~30-50 active 401(k) plan clients
- ~1,000 payments annually  
- Providers: John Hancock, Voya, Empower, Principal, Ascensus
- Payment types: Percentage (0.25% of assets) or flat fee
- Schedules: Monthly/quarterly, collected in arrears

---

.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
cd ..\tests
pytest
```

**Frontend Tests**:
```bash
npm test
# or for specific test file:
npm test -- --testPathPattern=api.test.ts
```

**Azure Functions** (Backend API):
```powershell
cd api
func start
```

```bash
npm run dev:teamsfx
```

**Environment Variables Required**:
- `SQL_SERVER` - Azure SQL server name
- `SQL_DATABASE` - Database name
- `REACT_APP_API_URL` - API endpoint (defaults to http://localhost:7071/api)

---

## DATABASE SCHEMA

**9 Tables**: clients, contracts, payments, contacts, client_files, payment_files, client_metrics, quarterly_summaries, yearly_summaries

**2 Views**: client_payment_status, payment_file_view

**Key Features**:
- Temporal tracking (valid_from/valid_to for soft deletes)
- Supports percentage (0.0025 = 0.25%) and flat fee contracts
- Payment period validation (1-12 monthly, 1-4 quarterly)
- All payments in arrears (one period behind current)
- Automated metrics via database triggers
- No split payments (simplified from old system)

---

## RECENT CHANGES

**2025-07-02**:
- Created missing `calculations/function.json` for variance endpoint
- Fixed all Azure Function import paths from `../../backend` to `..`
- Added temporal fields (valid_from/to) to frontend TypeScript interfaces
- Created comprehensive API service test suite (19 tests)
- Configured Jest testing framework for frontend
- Created detailed frontend migration plan documents

**Key Simplifications from Old System**:
- Removed split payment functionality (single period only)
- Removed overdue status (binary: Paid or Due)
- PDF viewer UI preserved but no backend implementation (placeholder only)
- Simplified from Next.js to React SPA for Teams



Azure Functions API Implementation
From the tests, I can see you've successfully built:
1. Database Layer ✅

Azure SQL connection using DefaultAzureCredential for authentication
Pydantic models with proper validation for all tables
Simplified payment structure - single period instead of complex split ranges
No more Period class - just applied_period_type, applied_period, applied_year

2. Working API Endpoints ✅
python# Payment CRUD
POST   /api/payments         # Create payment (returns 201)
GET    /api/payments/{id}    # Get single payment
DELETE /api/payments/{id}    # Soft delete

# Dashboard aggregation
GET    /api/dashboard/{client_id}    # Returns unified data:
  - client info
  - payment_status (current/due/overdue)
  - compliance (status, color, reason)  
  - recent_payments
  - metrics (from triggers)

# Available periods  
GET    /api/periods?client_id=X&contract_id=Y
  - Returns unpaid periods for payment form dropdown
3. Key Simplifications ✅

Period handling: Just "quarterly" + 3 + 2025 instead of start/end ranges
Metrics automated: Database triggers update client_metrics table
Pre-calculated views: client_payment_status view for status logic
No manual calculations: Everything happens in SQL

4. Architecture
Teams Tab (React) → Azure Functions API → Azure SQL
                     ↓
                  Azure Identity Auth
The tests prove the core API is working - creating payments, retrieving aggregated dashboard data, and getting available periods. This is a much cleaner foundation than the old hacky SQLite version!


FRONTEND DONE AND MIGRATED LETS TEST! 


# WORKERBEEZ LOG

## WorkerBee 1
**Name:** Prompt Rewriter  
**Task:** Read and rewrite prompt into clear form  
**Content:** 

**Goal:** Prepare Teams Tab app (401k payment tracker) for immediate deployment without errors.

**Context:**
- Migrated from SQLite to Azure SQL (complete)
- Backend: Python Azure Functions (tested and working)
- Frontend: React SPA (AI-migrated from Next.js, status unknown)
- Intentional changes: Single period payments only, no split payments, simplified compliance

**Requirements:**
1. Verify frontend matches old UI (except intentional changes)
2. Keep homepage with multiple navigation tiles (401k Payment Manager, AI Agenda Generator, etc)
3. Ensure Teams/Azure configs are deployment-ready
4. No enterprise complexity - simple micro app for <10 users
5. No tests needed - focus on visual/functional correctness

---

## HumanEyez Review 1
**Status:** APPROVED
**Comments:** Clear and concise. Captures essential goal and constraints.

---

## WorkerBee 2
**Name:** Code Comparator
**Task:** Compare old vs new code structure
**Content:**

**OLD STRUCTURE (Next.js):**
- Homepage: LaunchMenu with 5 navigation tiles
- Pages: index.js, payments.js, under-construction.js, etc
- Split payment controls present
- File structure: src/pages/, src/components/

**NEW STRUCTURE (React SPA):**
- Missing: Homepage with navigation tiles
- Current: Jumps straight to ClientDashboard
- Removed: Split payment controls (intentional)
- File structure: src/components/, src/static/scripts/app.tsx

**INTENTIONAL CHANGES:**
1. ✅ Removed split payment controls
2. ✅ Single period payments only
3. ✅ Simplified from Next.js to React SPA

**LIKELY UNINTENTIONAL:**
1. ❌ Missing homepage with navigation tiles
2. ❌ No route management for multiple modules
3. ❌ Lost under-construction placeholder for future modules

---

## HumanEyez Review 2
**Status:** APPROVED
**Comments:** Accurate comparison. Critical finding: missing homepage/navigation.

---

## WorkerBee 3
**Name:** Gameplan Architect
**Task:** Solidify implementation gameplan
**Content:**

**NEEDED MODIFICATIONS:**

1. **Homepage with Navigation Tiles**
   - Files: Create LaunchMenu.jsx component
   - Reason: User explicitly requires navigation tiles; old app had it
   - Evidence: OLDCODE shows index.js with 5 tiles; prompt states "YES we WANT TO KEEP THE SAME HOMEPAGE"
   - Ripple: Modify app.tsx to show LaunchMenu first, add routing

2. **Routing System**
   - Files: Add react-router-dom, modify app.tsx
   - Reason: Need navigation between modules
   - Evidence: Old app used Next.js routing; current has no routing
   - Ripple: Need UnderConstruction component, route definitions

3. **Under Construction Page**
   - Files: Create UnderConstruction.jsx
   - Reason: 4 of 5 modules not implemented yet
   - Evidence: Old app had under-construction.js for placeholder modules
   - Ripple: Routes for agenda, efip, structured-notes, ai-tools

**NO ACTION NEEDED:**
- Backend (tested and working)
- Payment components (already migrated)
- Teams configuration (properly set up)
- Build process (Vite + Express working)

---

## HumanEyez Review 3
**Status:** APPROVED
**Comments:** Solid plan. Evidence-based. Focused on actual gaps.

---

## WorkerBee 4
**Name:** Code Implementor
**Task:** Implement code changes
**Content:**

**COMPLETED:**

2. Added @heroicons/react to package.json  
3. Created LaunchMenu.jsx with 5 navigation tiles
4. Created UnderConstruction.jsx placeholder page
5. Modified app.tsx with Router and Routes

**IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:**
- LaunchMenu matches old design: grid layout, hover effects, icons
- Routes: /, /payments, /under-construction, /agenda, /efip, /structured-notes, /ai-tools
- Only /payments is functional; others show under construction
- Preserved Teams integration wrapper
