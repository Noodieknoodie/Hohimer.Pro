# WORKERBEEZ LOG

## WorkerBee 1
**Name:** Prompt Rewriter  
**Task:** Read and rewrite prompt into clear form  
**Content:** 

**Goal:** Prepare Teams Tab app (401k payment tracker) for immediate deployment without errors.

**Context:**
- Migrated from SQLite to Azure SQL (complete)
- Backend: Python Azure Functions (tested and working)
- Frontend: React SPA (AI-migrated from Next.js, status unknown)
- Intentional changes: Single period payments only, no split payments, simplified compliance

**Requirements:**
1. Verify frontend matches old UI (except intentional changes)
2. Keep homepage with multiple navigation tiles (401k Payment Manager, AI Agenda Generator, etc)
3. Ensure Teams/Azure configs are deployment-ready
4. No enterprise complexity - simple micro app for <10 users
5. No tests needed - focus on visual/functional correctness

## HumanEyez Review 1
**Status:** APPROVED
**Comments:** Clear and concise. Captures essential goal and constraints.

## WorkerBee 2
**Name:** Code Comparator
**Task:** Compare old vs new code structure
**Content:**

**OLD STRUCTURE (Next.js):**
- Homepage: LaunchMenu with 5 navigation tiles
- Pages: index.js, payments.js, under-construction.js, etc
- Split payment controls present
- File structure: src/pages/, src/components/

**NEW STRUCTURE (React SPA):**
- Missing: Homepage with navigation tiles
- Current: Jumps straight to ClientDashboard
- Removed: Split payment controls (intentional)
- File structure: src/components/, src/static/scripts/app.tsx

**INTENTIONAL CHANGES:**
1. ✅ Removed split payment controls
2. ✅ Single period payments only
3. ✅ Simplified from Next.js to React SPA

**LIKELY UNINTENTIONAL:**
1. ❌ Missing homepage with navigation tiles
2. ❌ No route management for multiple modules
3. ❌ Lost under-construction placeholder for future modules

---

## HumanEyez Review 2
**Status:** APPROVED
**Comments:** Accurate comparison. Critical finding: missing homepage/navigation.

---

## WorkerBee 3
**Name:** Gameplan Architect
**Task:** Solidify implementation gameplan
**Content:**

**NEEDED MODIFICATIONS:**

1. **Homepage with Navigation Tiles**
   - Files: Create LaunchMenu.jsx component
   - Reason: User explicitly requires navigation tiles; old app had it
   - Evidence: OLDCODE shows index.js with 5 tiles; prompt states "YES we WANT TO KEEP THE SAME HOMEPAGE"
   - Ripple: Modify app.tsx to show LaunchMenu first, add routing

2. **Routing System**
   - Files: Add react-router-dom, modify app.tsx
   - Reason: Need navigation between modules
   - Evidence: Old app used Next.js routing; current has no routing
   - Ripple: Need UnderConstruction component, route definitions

3. **Under Construction Page**
   - Files: Create UnderConstruction.jsx
   - Reason: 4 of 5 modules not implemented yet
   - Evidence: Old app had under-construction.js for placeholder modules
   - Ripple: Routes for agenda, efip, structured-notes, ai-tools

**NO ACTION NEEDED:**
- Backend (tested and working)
- Payment components (already migrated)
- Teams configuration (properly set up)
- Build process (Vite + Express working)

---

## HumanEyez Review 3
**Status:** APPROVED
**Comments:** Solid plan. Evidence-based. Focused on actual gaps.

## WorkerBee 4
**Name:** Code Implementor
**Task:** Implement code changes
**Content:**

**COMPLETED:**
1. Added react-router-dom to package.json
2. Added @heroicons/react to package.json  
3. Created LaunchMenu.jsx with 5 navigation tiles
4. Created UnderConstruction.jsx placeholder page
5. Modified app.tsx with Router and Routes

**IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:**
- LaunchMenu matches old design: grid layout, hover effects, icons
- Routes: /, /payments, /under-construction, /agenda, /efip, /structured-notes, /ai-tools
- Only /payments is functional; others show under construction
- Preserved Teams integration wrapper
